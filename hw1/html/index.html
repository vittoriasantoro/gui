      <p class="main-para">I was fortunate enough to travel to Argentina last year on April. It was my first time going to South
         America! I cannot state enough how amazing it was to travel to a new continent and really immerse myself in a
         new culture and environment
      <p>
      <h2>Why I Picked Argentina</h2>
      <p>I first decided on going to Argentina after my friend threw out the idea. At the time, she left her job and
         had time before her new job started (2 months I believe). She wanted to spend that time solo backpacking across
         South America! She wanted me to join her, but I unfortunately would not be able to join for a trip longer than
         two weeks since I had work. Since she was following the Andes mountains from Peru to Argentina, I decided to
         join her in her last leg of the trip, in North West Argentina!
      </p>
      <h2>Travel</h2>
      <p>I decided to fly Delta, as they offered a non stop flight from JFK to EZE (International Airport in
         Buenos Aires). I was nervous I would not be able to sleep in the flight to Buenos Aires, but I ended up knocking out for
         most of the flight (thankfully!!!). Now this is when it gets fun. I needed to take a flight from the other airport in Buenos Aires
         to meet my friend in <i>San Salvador de Jujuy</i>, the capital of the Jujuy province. This was my first time in Argentina, and
         my Spanish was extremely limited... Thankfully I speak italian which is super close to Spanish, so I was able to converse with some taxi drivers
         and get a taxi ride form one airport to the next, all the while stopping at a Western Union to get some cash.

      <p>Cash in Argentina was definitely a hot commodity. Considering inflation was about 1000% in the past 5 years, most Argentinians
         held their cash in currencies other than the local Argentinian Pesos, and then exchanged it at Western Unions for a "black market" exchange
         rate, which was much lower than the actual exchange rate. Great for tourists because we got insane value for the dollar, not great for the locals
         at all however. Western Unions are known to run out of cash, leaving a lot of Argentinians high and dry. As of now, May 2025, inflation has plunged
         to 66.9% though, so things are improving!
      </p>
      <p>The bus system in rural Argentina is very nice, so we were able to travel around with a bus. We decided to rent a car for a Salta&DoubleLongRightArrow;Cafayate&DoubleLongRightArrow;Cachi road trip,
         but other than that we relied on mostly public transportation
