      <p class="main-para">After our jaunt in <i>Jujuy</i>, we traveled to <i>Salta</i>, the capital of the region Salta.
         There we picked up a car, and started our road trip! Our plan was to go from Salta&DoubleRightArrow;Cafayate&DoubleRightArrow;Cachi, and then back to Salta.
      <p>
      <h2>Salta to Cafayate</h2>
      <p>Thankfully this part of the trip was paved, and we got to see some cool touristy destinations on the way there! We visited
         <i>La Garganta del Diablo</i>, or the devil's throat, and <i>El Sapo</i>, or the toad

      <h2>Cafayate to Cachi</h2>
      <p>Cafayate and Cachi are both valleys known for their wine. Lush valleys accompanied us on the road to Cachi. We sadly could not
         drink much wine since we were driving, but the wine we did get to try was delicious!

      <h2>Cachi to Salta</h2>
      <p>Cachi to Salta brought us through <i>Parque Nacional los Cardones</i>, or Cactus National Park. I have never seen cacti as big as
         these. The road was largely unpaved, which meant we had to drive much slower than before. While the trip took us a long time, we were
         glad to take it slow so we could appreciate the great views!
